Dear reader,  
This repository contains the code, outline and slides for the **QLS-MiCM Intermediate Python** workshop at McGill in Fall 2024.

This workshop is the second part of a two-part series. The first part, **Intro to Python** can be found [here](https://github.com/bzrudski/micm_intro_to_python_fall_2024).

This workshop is based on my previous iterations of this workshop and the **Intro to Python** workshop, which can be found at the following repositories:
* [Intro to Python - Summer 2024](https://github.com/bzrudski/micm_intro_to_python_summer_2024)
* [Intro to Python - Winter 2024](https://github.com/bzrudski/micm_intro_to_python_winter_2024)
* [Intro to Python - Summer 2023](https://github.com/bzrudski/micm_intro_to_python_summer_2023)
* [Intro to Python - Fall 2022](https://github.com/bzrudski/micm_intro_to_python_fall_2022)
* [Intermediate Python - Summer 2024](https://github.com/bzrudski/micm_intermediate_python_summer_2024)
* [Intermediate Python - Fall 2023](https://github.com/bzrudski/micm_intermediate_python_fall_2023)

This workshop covers topics related to writing functions and using modules and packages with the Python programming language, as well as working with environments.
