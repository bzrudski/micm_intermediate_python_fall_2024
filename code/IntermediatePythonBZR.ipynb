    "Welcome! In this interactive Jupyter notebook, we will explore intermediate-level skills in the Python programming language. We'll cover material from functions and data classes to processing and visualising data using popular libraries. This workshop assumes that you have a basic knowledge of Python. If you don't feel free to check out some beginner resources. In a shameless self-promotion plug, you may find my [Intro to Python workshop]() helpful. We'll also review some of the core concepts before diving into new material, but I encourage you to make sure you're comfortable with the basics before tackling the new material.\n",
    "\n",
    "This workshop contains various exercises to help you practice the material. This notebook is the **student version**, which contains several blanks where I will write code during the workshop and where you can fill out exercises. There is a **solution version** in the [`solutions`](../solutions/) folder. I recommend trying the exercises yourself before looking at the solutions, There is often more than one way to answer a programming question, so you should focus more on understanding the code that you are writing, instead of just copying my answers. You may come up with an answer better than the one I've provided!"

    "In this module, we make sure that everyone is on the same playing field in terms of basic Python knowledge. This section is meant to **briefly** cover the important concepts. It does **not** replace an introductory course.\n",

    "## Quick Review\n",
    "\n",
    "In this quick review, we explore two main questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What is Python?\n",
    "2. What are its key ideas and important syntax elements?\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a **free and open-source**, **object-oriented** and **interpreted** programming language. Here's a bit more detail:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Free and open-source:** Anyone can download, install, use, copy, modify and redistribute Python. Everyone can see how Python is developed and even contribute to the project.\n",
    "* **Object-oriented:** everything in Python is represented as an **object**, or a grouping of data, called **attributes** with behaviour, called **methods**.\n",
    "* **Interpreted:** There's no need to compile Python code. Python runs your code one line at a time, so it's easy to make changes to your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information about Python, make sure to check out the official Python website at https://www.python.org."

    "* `str` - Text string. For example: `\"Hello, World!\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Collection Types\n",
    "* `tuple` - Tuple, containing a small fixed number of values, not necessarily of the same type. Enclosed in round brackets. For example: `(404, \"Not Found\")`.\n",
    "* `list` - List, containing a variable number of elemnts, typically of the same type. Enclosed in square brackets. For example: `[\"T\", \"R\", \"M\", \"A\", \"Q\"]`.\n",
    "* `dict` - Dictionary, containing key-value pairs. Enclosed in brace brackets. For example: `{\"purines\": [\"A\", \"G\"], \"pyrimidines\": [\"C\", \"U\", \"T\"]}`.\n",

    "\n",

    "### A Bit of Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, functions are defined using the `def` keyword. The syntax is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "def function_name(argument1, argument2, argument3, ..., argumentN):\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",

    "\n",
    "    return some_value\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here are the important elements to notice when **defining** a function:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The function definition begins with the `def` keyword. This is similar to the `function` keyword in Javascript, or the `func` keyword in Swift.\n",
    "* The **function name** follows the same rules as variable names. There are different naming conventions for names that consist of multiple words (`snake_case` vs `camelCase`). By common convention, the function name starts with a **lowercase** letter.\n",
    "* After the function name, you can include a list of parameters in parentheses. **If your function takes no arguments, you must still put the brackets.** Each argument in the list must have a valid variable name. We'll discuss these in more detail later.\n",
    "* After closing the argument list bracket, we put a **colon** (`:`).\n",
    "* After the first line, we must **indent**. This tells Python where the function body begins and ends.\n",
    "* We can start the body with a **docstring**, which describes the function. We'll discuss these more later.\n",
    "* Then, you write your code as normal. In this function body, treat the arguments **like normal variables**.\n",
    "* To **output** a result that can be used later, use the keyword `return`, followed by the result. We'll discuss this more later.\n",
    "* After finishing to define the function, simply stop indenting. There's no need to close any brackets or type `end`."

    "The packages available to install in `conda` come from various channels available via the **Anaconda** repository: https://anaconda.org/. We can search online to find a package that we want to install. For example, if you want to install matplotlib, you can search for **matplotlib** on the Anaconda repository. Then, you can easily install it using the **command line terminal** (not a Python console).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Installing Packages on the Command Line\n",
    "\n",
    "To install using the **command line**, open up the **Terminal** on macOS or Linux, or the **Anaconda Prompt** on Windows. It's very important to **not** use a Python shell for this. Again, we do this in a terminal, **NOT IN A PYTHON SHELL**.\n",
    "\n",
    "If everything is set up properly, you should see `(base)` before the prompt. This indicates that you are in the base `conda` environment.\n",
    "\n",

    "```bash\n",
    "$ conda install package_name\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Press enter, wait for it to prompt you, type `y` and hit enter again to install! If you don't want to be prompted, then you can just add `-y` to the command so that it automatically answers \"yes\" to the prompt for installation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, the package that you want isn't available in the main channel, or only an older version is available. If the package you want isn't available in the main `anaconda` channel, you can specify the `conda-forge` channel instead using the `-c` option (see [here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/commands/install.html) for more details).\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ conda install -c conda-forge package_name\n",

    "\n",
    "**Note:** `pip` should come with just about any installation of Python. If you didn't install Anaconda, things may get a bit messy. There are two major versions of Python in use: 2.7 and 3.*. On some operating systems, typing in `python` or `pip` on the command line use Python 2, while you must use `python3` or `pip3` to use the more updated and supported version of Python. When you install Anaconda or Miniconda, you no longer need to deal with this issue. This issues is becoming less common, as Python 2.7 has been deprecated."

    "Most packages give you information in the **documentation** about how to install them. In practice, you rarely have to search Anaconda or PyPI. Usually, you just need to search for the package, and it will explain how to set it up.\n",

    "An example is [CuPy](https://cupy.dev/), which allows performing NumPy and SciPy operations on the GPU. This package **does not** work on all systems. It requires an NVIDIA GPU and CUDA, which is not available on macOS. In these cases, it's very important to read the [installation instructions](https://docs.cupy.dev/en/stable/install.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have both `conda` and `pip` installed, the `conda` [documentation](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) recommends trying to install packages with `conda` first.

    "### A Brief Introduction to Environments\n",
    "\n",
    "I've tossed the word **environment** out a couple of times. But, what is an environment?\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python programming, an **environment** contains your **Python interpreter** and all the **associated packages**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why Use Environments?\n",
    "\n",
    "If you start working on complicated projects, you'll notice a few things:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Things sometimes break over time. New versions of packages add new features, but sometimes remove or change other features. Sometimes, your task may require a specific version of a package. For example, your task may require `numpy` version `1.26` and not `2.0`.\n",
    "* The above, but for your dependencies. Sometimes, a package that you use depends on a specific version of another package.\n",
    "* Some projects you're working on may require some versions of a package, while others require a different version.\n",
    "* If you're sharing your code with a colleague, they'll need to install specific packages to run your code. It's easier to give them as short a list of dependencies as possible, and you need to communicate the correct package versions to them.\n",
    "* New versions of Python itself add new features and introduce new syntax. It's important to let people know exactly what version of Python you're working with so that your code will run properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Sample environments for different projects.](../assets/environment/Environments.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Image made with PowerPoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python environments help you to simplify these tasks by allowing you to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Keep different versions of the same package isolated.\n",
    "* Have multiple versions of Python installed.\n",
    "* Export your installed packages and dependencies to a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are **many** different ways to create new Python environments. We'll discuss two:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `conda` environments\n",
    "* `virtualenv` environments"

    "#### Managing Environments with `conda`\n",
    "\n",
    "Using `conda`, it's easy to set up environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, when you install Anaconda or Miniconda, you are provided with the `base` environment. To create a new environment, open up the **terminal** (or the **Anaconda Prompt** on Windows) and type:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda create -n environment_name\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can optionally specify packages to install immediately when creating the environment. For example, you can create a new environment called `py39` with Python 3.9 and NumPy 1.26 installed from `conda-forge` by writing:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda create -n py39 -c conda-forge python=3.9 numpy=1.26\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After creating your new environment, you have to **activate** it. This is easy! You just need to type\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda activate environment_name\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In our example, you would write\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda activate py39\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you'll see that the environment name beside your command prompt changes. To deactivate the environment and return to the base, you would write\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda deactivate\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** If you deactivate the base, you've completely closed Anaconda and you can't use `conda` until you restart it.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the advantages of Conda environments is that they are very easy to export as a file listing all your installed packages. You do this using the `conda env export` subcommand:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda env export -f my_env.yml\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you have a file that can tell `conda` exactly how to recreate your Python environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a new environment based on this file, you can simply run this code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda env create -f my_env.yml -n new_env\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you'll have a new environment called `new_env` that has the **same packages** that are listed in `my_env.yml`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To activate this new environment, you would type:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda activate new_env\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For more details on managing Conda environments, check out the `conda` documentation [here](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html). There are also detailed help pages about all of the `conda` commands and subcommands."

    "#### Creating Virtual Environments `virtualenv` and `pip`\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also create environments using `virtualenv` and `pip`. These environments are known as **virtual environments**.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we need to install `virtualenv`. If you've installed Anaconda or Miniconda, you can install `virtualenv` using `conda`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda install virtualenv\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Otherwise, you can install `virtualenv` using `pip`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install virtualenv\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike working with Conda environments, when creating environments with `virtualenv`, you **must** specify where you want the environment files to be stored. To create an environment in the subdirectory `env` of the current folder, run the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "virtualenv env\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will create the environment and will give you a message saying it has been created. Like with Conda environments, you must activate this virtual environment before using it. The activate is **different** on Windows from macOS and Linux.\n",
    "\n",
    "On macOS and Linux, you must type:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "source env/bin/activate\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "On Windows, you must type:\n",
    "\n",
    "```powershell\n",
    ".\\env\\Scripts\\activate\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In both cases, after you activate your environment, you should see the name of the environment before the command prompt. To deactivate the environment, simply type:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "deactivate\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "With the environment active, you can install packages using `pip`. These packages will only be installed in the **active** environment. **DON'T INSTALL PACKAGES USING `conda` WHEN WORKING IN A VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT!**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** If you had to use `pip3` before, you won't have to in a virtual environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to how we exported a Conda environment, we can export a list of package versions with `pip`. The package information is stored in a **requirements** file, commonly called `requirements.txt`. To create this file, at the command line, you use `pip freeze`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip freeze > requirements.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will create a file containing the names of all your installed packages and the exact version.\n",
    "\n",
    "After creating another environment, you can easily install all these packages using `pip` by writing:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information about creating virtual environments using `virtualenv`, make sure to check out the [documentation](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Closing Environment Remarks\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several differences between Conda environments and virtual environments that are beyond the scope of this workshop. There are also several other tools for managing environments and dependencies. These include **Poetry** (https://python-poetry.org/) and **Pixi** (https://pixi.sh/latest/). I **strongly** recommend that you check these out if you are interested in developing and distributing Python packages for other people to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "And lastly, **please, please, please** don't mix `conda` and `pip` unless you **absolutely have to**. If you are working with a Conda environment and the package documentation doesn't indicate a way to install it using `conda`, check the [online list](https://conda-forge.org/packages/) at `conda-forge` to see if someone has uploaded a version to `conda-forge`."

    "DNA sequences can be very long. After all, we have billions of nucleotides of DNA in each cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sequences that are are very long don't look nice on the screen. To make our sequences easier to read (and to make them easier to ultimately export to FASTA files), we want to wrap the sequences and break them into several smaller lines of 80 nucleotides.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could do this manually... but, as it turns out, Python includes a [`textwrap` module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/textwrap.html#module-textwrap) that can help! Read the module documentation and write code to break a DNA sequence into smaller chunks. I've given you a DNA sequence to test this code on.\n",

    "## What to Learn Next... and How?\n",
    "\n",
    "We've seen a lot. But, the learning is never done! There are many more topics that you can explore, both in terms of Python syntax skills and external packages. With the tools that you've now learned, it should be fairly easy for you to learn them. Here are some topics that are definitely worth looking into:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using NumPy for Array Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "While we can use basic lists for storing multiple values, things get quite complicated if you want to represent higher dimensional data and perform operations on large sets of data. Good news! The [NumPy](https://numpy.org) package offers a new type of object: the `ndarray`, the `N`-dimensional array. Using these arrays, you can easily store and process lots of numbers easily. And NumPy also contains the mathematical operations you need for processing. NumPy is **extremely commonly used**, so if you're doing something that involves lots of data, chances are that you'll be using NumPy in some form. Make sure to check out the [online documentation](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/) for help getting started.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Generating Plots\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have lots of data, you'll certainly want to use plots to help with visualisations. There are several commonly-used plotting packages in Python. Make sure to checkout [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/). The documentation for this package contains **tons of examples** showing just what you can do in terms of plotting. [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) is another package that builds on Matplotlib. If you're familiar with R, then [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/) can also be used in Python. If you're doing visualisation in 3D, there are also packages for that!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using SciPy for Scientific Computing and Pandas for Data Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "[SciPy](https://scipy.org/) and [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) are the next logical steps after NumPy. SciPy provides some more advanced scientific operations, like signal processing, spatial operations and mathematical optimisation. The docs are structured quite similarly to NumPy, and NumPy arrays are at the basis of just about all of SciPy, so it shouldn't be too hard to jump right in. Meanwhile, Pandas provides more advanced data manipulation for spreadsheet-like objects. This is quite helpful if your data are mostly 2D and you have more than just numeric data. Check out these packages' websites for tips to get started.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Image Processing with Scikit-Image\n",
    "\n",
    "Much life science work relies on processing images. [Scikit-image](https://scikit-image.org/) provides many functions for processing images and getting insight.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "Want to get started with advanced statistics and machine learning in Python? Check out [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/). This package provides tools for clustering, dimensionality reduction and much more!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Object-Oriented Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "We've talked about how everything in Python is an **object**. You can create new types of objects using **classes**. A **class** is a **template** for creating new objects. Basic object-oriented programming should be covered in most introductory books on Python, as well as in online tutorials. You can also check out the official Python documentation for some [info](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html) on defining classes."

If you want to learn how to use a function, **look it up** and read the paragraph about it. The docs will tell you how to use the arguments, as well as any quirks to expect. In some cases, the authors have even included references to the papers behind the function. This is especially true in image processing and other fields that rely heavily on algorithms. So, the documentation will tell you not only how to use the code, but also **where it comes from**. And make sure to check out the **Official Python docs** at https://docs.python.org/3/.\n",

    "\n",
    "Make sure that you **understand** the code that you're about to add to your project and **don't just copy-paste** it. Re-type it yourself. Coding is a thinking game. Make sure that you have thought about all the code that you're putting in and that you understand why it's there. \n",

    "\n",
    "Answers on Stack Overflow are written by **humans** who have written the code, tested it, and run it themselves. So, even if it doesn't work for you, you know that it worked for someone at some point in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Be careful** when using ChatGPT for code (if you're allowed to at all). Read the code **carefully**, make extra sure that it makes sense, and test it. Don't just stare at it for two seconds, blink, and think \"Looks right\". Actually try to dissect the code. Don't just trust it because AI wrote it for you. Otherwise you might wind up putting [glue on your pizza](https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/23/24162896/google-ai-overview-hallucinations-glue-in-pizza).\n",
    "\n",

    "### Concluding Help Remarks...\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, ALWAYS remember to **read the documentation**. Often, if you're stuck, the answer is **right there**. If it's not, then it's probably on Stack Overflow. It's often a good idea to check the documentation **first** to see if there's an official explanation or an official example. And don't just copy a Stack Overflow answer or sample code. Think about what the code is doing. Does it make sense? Is there a better way? Try to look line by line to understand what is going on (play around in the IPython interpreter or in a Jupyter notebook!)."

    "## Other Cool Programming Topics\n",
    "\n",
    "Aside from the packages that I discussed above, there are other cool topics that you should definitely take a look at! These will help you write code that runs better, is easier to update and is easier to share.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Writing Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "We've seen how to install and use packages. But, you can also **write your own packages**. There are many great resources online about writing packages. The one that I most recommend is [this free online book](https://py-pkgs.org/): *Python Packages* by Tomas Beuszen and Tiffany Timbers. It's an easy read and helps you learn not only how to organise your code, but how to publish it, too. The authors also walk through how to render your own nice-looking documentation and host that online. This book doesn't only talk about code, but really about an entire ecosystem of tools that are extremely helpful when developing something new.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Object-Oriented and Functional Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an **object-oriented language**. So, everything is an object! Using classes, you can create new types of objects. Python offers different ways of creating classes that are worth checking out, including data classes and enumerations. Python also offers **functional programming** tools, allowing you to do more with functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Developing Graphical User Interfaces\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks and command line scripts are powerful, but they aren't accessible for people who don't know how to code. Solution: build a graphical user interface! Using PyQt, the process is quite straightforward. Check out [this online tutorial series](https://www.pythonguis.com/) by Martin Fitzpatrick to learn about developing GUIs in Python. It has been a great help to me in my own research.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Warning:** GUI development takes **a lot** of time. Make sure that your processing code is stable before you embark on wrapping it up into a GUI.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hosting Projects on GitHub\n",
    "\n",
    "What fun is a project if other people can't use it? By hosting your project on GitHub, you let others easily contribute to your project and build on it. Learning Git and GitHub are essential! And so are a few other skills along the way, like writing documents in Markdown. MiCM often has Git and GitHub workshops, so check out their workshop schedule!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "We've reached the end of this workshop. You now have more skills that will help you:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. develop the software tools you'll need in your research, and\n",
    "2. learn how to use additional packages not covered.\n",
